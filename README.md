This project aims to construct a house price model in Python from the given dataset of London house prices. Implementation is done using the k nearest neighbors algorithm, for which a series of steps in the machine learning systematic process cycle are followed and justified.
Upon realization, we aim to visualize the said model with customizable accuracy to plot house prices in 3-D for a given set of floor areas across the co-ordinates of London.
